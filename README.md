# Weex Vue Examples

Single page examples written in Weex and Vue.js.

**[The Example Website](https://hanks10100.github.io/weex-vue-examples/)**

The source code the website is in the `docs` folder. Here is other resources:

+ [Weex Online Playground](http://dotwe.org/vue)
+ [Weex Playground App](https://weex-project.io/playground.html)

## Develop

Clone the project and install dependencies (`npm install`), then:

+ `npm run serve`: Start a web server on port 8080.
+ `npm run build`: Build the source files.
+ `npm run dev`: Watch the file changes and auto build.

## Contribute

**Write an example on [Weex online playground](http://dotwe.org/vue) and add the url to a proper place in [`examples/`](./examples/), then send a PR.**

The example should contain these massages:

+ `hash`: The md5 hash in the example's link address.
+ `title`: A brief title of the example. It's better to have both Chinese and English titles.
+ `screenshot`: [optional] The screen shot of the example. It's better to upload the image to a CDN and just offer an address, don't upload the image file to the repo.
